### **CHAPTER 4**
### **The Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526 CE)**

The period between 1206 CE and 1526 CE in the history of India is known as the Period of the Delhi Sultanate. As many as five ruling dynasties dominated the scene during this period: the Slaves, the Khaljis, the Tughlaqs, the Sayyids, and the Lodis.

In 1206 CE, Muhammad Ghori was murdered, and his Indian possessions fell under the control of his slave and military general, Qutubuddin Aibak. With this began the rule of the Slave Dynasty and the Delhi Sultans.

#### **HISTORICAL SOURCES**

We have a wealth of historical sources for the Sultanate Period (1206-1526). Various chronicles, travellers' accounts, and historic buildings provide valuable information.

**Court Chronicles**
Histories (or *Twarikh*) written by the court chroniclers of various Delhi Sultans are an important source. Among them, Amir Khusrau's *Tughluqnama* and *Tarikh-i-Alai*; Zia-ud-Din Barani's *Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi*; *Futuhat-i-Firuz Shah* by Sultan Firuz Shah himself; Yahya-bin-Ahmed's *Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi*; and *Makhzan-i-Afghana* by Niamatullah throw a great deal of light on the personalities and main events of the different Delhi Sultans.

**Travellers' Accounts**
Many foreign travellers who visited India during this period also shed light on the personality and administration of different Sultans. Among them, the names of Ibn Battuta, Marco Polo, and Afanasy Nikitin are well known.

**Historic Buildings**
The historic buildings of this period, such as the Qutub Minar, Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, Alai Darwaza, the Tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, the Tughlaqabad fort complex, Hauz Khas, Firoz Shah Kotla, and the Lodi Tombs, speak to the artistic tastes of the different Delhi Sultans.

#### **THE KHALJI DYNASTY (1290-1320 CE)**

**Alauddin Khalji's Conquest of the Deccan (1305-1311 CE)**
Alauddin Khalji was the first Muslim ruler to attempt the conquest of the Deccan. His general, Malik Kafur, was entrusted with this task.

1.  **Devagiri (1306-1307 CE):** Its ruler, Ramachandra of the Yadava dynasty, was captured, sent to Delhi, and then returned to Devagiri to rule as a vassal.
2.  **Warangal (1309 CE):** Pratap Rudradeva of the Kakatiya dynasty submitted to Malik Kafur after significant resistance.
3.  **Dwarasamudra (1310 CE):** Raja Vira Ballala III of the Hoysala dynasty submitted to Malik Kafur in November 1310.
4.  **Madurai (1311 CE):** Malik Kafur defeated Vira Pandya and then marched to Rameshwaram, building mosques in many places. After this, he returned to Delhi.

Alauddin Khalji died in 1316 CE, and soon thereafter, the Khalji dynasty fell and was supplanted by a new dynasty, the Tughlaqs.

#### **CASE STUDY: THE TUGHLAQ DYNASTY (1320-1414 CE)**

The Tughlaq Dynasty was one of the most important dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate, ruling for nearly a century.

**Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq (1320-1325 CE)**
Ghazi Malik, who assumed the title of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, was the founder of this dynasty. He usurped the throne from Khusro Khan, the last ruler of the Khalji dynasty.
* He reformed the judiciary and police departments.
* The land revenue was reduced to `$1/10$` of the produce.
* He carried out many works of public utility: canals were dug, gardens were planted, and forts were built for the protection of the people.
* He built the new city of Tughlaqabad near Delhi.
The Sultan was killed in 1325 CE under mysterious circumstances, and his son, Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq, ascended the throne.

**Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq (1325-1351 CE)**
Muhammad Tughlaq was a learned man, skilled in mathematics, philosophy, astronomy, logic, and medicine. He was a poet and a good orator with a sharp memory. However, his scholarly qualities failed him in practical governance. The account of the Moroccan traveller, Ibn Battuta, who was appointed as the chief Qazi of Delhi, is a special source of information. According to Ibn Battuta, Muhammad Tughlaq was a great scholar but a strange man who offended the orthodox ulema, which is why they called him 'a mixture of opposites'. Some of his plans were disastrous and ruined his empire:

1.  **Transfer of Capital (1326-1327 CE):** Shifting the capital from Delhi to Devagiri (renamed Daulatabad) in the Deccan brought untold misery to the people. After a few years, he shifted the capital back to Delhi.
2.  **Introduction of Token Currency:** He issued a large number of copper coins which were to have the same value as the existing silver and gold coins. Fake copper coins soon flooded the market, leading to the collapse of the financial system.
3.  **Taxation in the Doab:** He enhanced taxation in the Doab to one-half of the produce at a time when the region was in the grip of a famine. This proved to be a disastrous move.
4.  **Other Unwise Plans:** To fend off Mongol threats, he paid their warriors huge sums of money to retreat. He also planned ambitious and costly conquests of Persia and Transoxiana amidst difficult financial conditions.

> **Did you know?**
> Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq was a versatile scholar. He ran a hospital where patients received free help, food, and drink. He was also known to be a good bone-setter.

**Firuz Shah Tughlaq (1351-1388 CE)**
As Muhammad Tughlaq had no son, his cousin, Firuz Tughlaq, succeeded him. Firuz Shah was regarded by many as an ideal ruler.
* He started many schemes for the welfare of his subjects: rest houses were built, and charity departments and employment bureaus were opened. He even set up a separate department for slaves.
* He adopted appeasement policies to gain the support of his nobles and the ulema. He granted lands to the ulema and made *iqtas* hereditary. To please the orthodox ulema, he imposed the *jizya* tax on Brahmins.
* He founded the new cities of Hisar, Firozpur, Jaunpur, and Firozabad. He also constructed many dams, canals, mosques, and *madrasas* (schools).
* He built the fort named Firoz Shah Kotla.

Despite his measures, a general decline of the Sultanate began within two decades of his death.

**Timur's Invasion and the Downfall of the Tughlaq Empire (1398 CE)**
The successors of Firuz Shah were weak. In 1398 CE, Amir Timur (also known as Tamerlane), the Mongol king from Central Asia, invaded India. The ruler in Delhi at the time was Nasiruddin Mahmud Tughlaq.
Timur started from Samarkand with 92,000 horsemen, carrying fire and sword wherever he went. He faced little opposition in Punjab and soon reached the gates of Delhi, where he unleashed immense killing, plundering, and looting. After about a fortnight in Delhi, he marched to Meerut, Haridwar, Nagarkot, and Jammu before returning to Central Asia. Before leaving, Timur appointed Khizr Khan as his viceroy in Multan. He left North India devastated, from which it could not recover for a long time. Timur's invasion paved the way for Babur's invasion of India.

#### **THE SAYYID DYNASTY (1414-1451 CE)**

After the death of Mahmud Tughlaq, Khizr Khan, the Governor of Multan and Timur's deputy, marched upon Delhi. He defeated Daulat Khan Lodi, occupied the throne, and laid the foundation of the Sayyid dynasty. This dynasty ruled until 1451 CE, when its last ruler, Alauddin Alam Shah, was defeated by Bahlol Lodi, the governor of Lahore.

---

#### **THE LODI DYNASTY (1451-1526 CE)**

**Bahlul Lodi (1451-1488 CE)**
Bahlul Lodi was the founder of the Lodi dynasty. He was a generous ruler who brought a degree of peace and order back to the country. In 1488 CE, Bahlul Lodi died and was succeeded by his son, Sikandar Lodi.

**Sikandar Lodi (1488-1517 CE)**
Sikandar Lodi is believed to be the greatest ruler of the Lodi dynasty. In 1504 CE, he founded the city of Agra and made it the headquarters of his army. Sikandar was a good administrator who maintained the dignity of his office. Trade was promoted through better-protected roads. The book *Tarikh-i-Daudi* speaks highly of him. He fell ill and died in 1517 CE.

**Ibrahim Lodi (1517-1526 CE)**
Ibrahim Lodi, the son of Sikandar Lodi, was the last king of the Delhi Sultanate. He was ill-tempered and lost the sympathy of his relatives and nobles. Revolts broke out everywhere. Babur, the Mughal ruler of Kabul, invaded India. He reached Panipat, near Delhi, in 1526 CE. A fierce battle (the First Battle of Panipat, 1526) took place between the forces of Babur and Ibrahim. Ibrahim was defeated and killed. Thus, the Delhi Sultanate came to an end, and Babur founded the Mughal Empire in India.

#### **CAUSES OF THE DOWNFALL OF THE DELHI SULTANATE**

Several factors contributed to the downfall of the Delhi Sultanate:

1.  **Despotic Rule:** The Sultans ruled by the sword and never tried to win the confidence of their subjects. Only strong rulers like Balban and Alauddin Khalji could maintain order.
2.  **Weak Rulers:** Most of the later Sultans were weak. The nobles often revolted when they saw an opportunity.
3.  **Disloyal Nobility:** The nobles often lacked loyalty to the Sultan and conspired for power.
4.  **Ill-Organised Army:** The army was poorly organised and disciplined. Most Sultans depended on the armies supplied by their nobles.
5.  **Jagirdari System:** The system of granting land (*jagirs*) created powerful nobles who were always looking for opportunities to revolt against weak Sultans.
6.  **No Definite Law of Succession:** The sword decided the succession, leading to continuous wars and intrigues for the throne.
7.  **Mongol Invasions:** The repeated invasions by the Mongols weakened the empire over time.
8.  **Timur's Invasion:** Timur's invasion struck a fatal blow to the Tughlaq dynasty and the Sultanate.
9.  **Babur's Invasion:** Babur's invasion delivered the final blow, ending the Sultanate in Delhi.

#### **DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS**

**Government and Administration**
The Sultan was a despot who ruled with the help of nobles. The law was based on Islamic tradition, and the *Qazis* and *Ulema* had a significant hand in the administration. The Sultan's power rested on his military might, and he administered all functions of the government.

The central government was run by various departments, with four being the most important:
* **Diwan-i-Wizarat:** Headed by the *Wazir* (Chief Minister).
* **Diwan-i-Arz:** Headed by the *Ariz-i-Mumalik* (Paymaster of the army).
* **Diwan-i-Insha:** Looked after state correspondence.
* **Diwan-i-Risalat:** Dealt with religious affairs and endowments.

The provincial government mirrored the setup at the centre. The heads of the provinces (*iqtas*) were known as *Wali* or *Muqti*. Provinces were subdivided into *shiqs* and *parganas*. A group of villages was headed by an *Amil*.

**Military Control**
The very existence of the Sultanate depended on its military strength. The Sultans had conquered India with their armies and used military force to maintain law and order, suppress rebellious nobles, and defend against foreign invasions. A strong military was essential for their survival.

**The Court, Nobility, and Land Control**
* **The Court:** The Delhi Sultans maintained a splendid court. According to Ibn Battuta, a visitor had to pass through three heavily guarded gates to reach the main court, which was a large hall supported by polished wooden pillars and decorated with costly furnishings.
* **Nobility:** The nobles, who helped the Sultan rule, primarily belonged to the Turkish or Afghan clans. Over time, Indian Muslims were also appointed as officers.
* **Land Control and Revenue:** The Sultans took several measures to increase their revenue. Land was the major source of their income. Some land, known as *Khalisa*, was reserved for the Sultan's personal expenses. The rest of the land was distributed among officers and nobles as *iqtas*. These nobles collected land revenue, used a portion for their salary and to maintain soldiers for the Sultan, and lived a life of luxury with the surplus. A separate Agriculture Department, the *Diwan-i-Amir-Kohi*, looked after land revenue, assisted by officers like the *Amil* and *Patwari*.

**Main Sources of Revenue**
* **Khiraj (Land Revenue):** Generally realised at `$1/5$` of the total produce, though some Sultans like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughlaq raised it to `$1/2$` of the total produce.
* **Jaziya Tax:** A tax imposed on non-Muslims. Children, women, and the infirm were generally exempt.
* **Zakat Tax:** A religious tax supposed to be paid by all Muslims.
* **Octroi Duty:** Realised on the exchange and transportation of commercial goods. Import tax was levied on goods from other countries.
* **Other Sources:** The state's share in plunder (*khums*), which was calculated at `$1/5$`, plus gifts and tributes from subordinate rulers.

#### **KEY TERMS**

* **The Slave Dynasty:** A dynasty of Turkish slave-officers who became rulers.
* **Vassal:** A subordinate chief or ruler.
* **Chalisa:** A group of forty influential Turkish nobles.
* **Sijdah:** Salutation by touching the ground with the forehead.
* **Madrasa:** Muslim schools for higher learning.
* **Jaziya:** A religious tax imposed on non-Muslims.
* **Turkish nobility:** Nobles of the Turkic clans who held high posts under the Delhi Sultans.
